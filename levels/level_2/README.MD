## Introduction

Welcome back for **Day 2!** <br/>

We're thrilled to see you again and congrats on completing the first day. We hope you've had the opportunity to connect with your teammates and enjoyed the networking session. <br/>

Today, we'll delve deeper into the Motoko language, learn about datastructures and how build our first **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application.

## Your tasks ‚úÖ

## Concepts üß†

> This is a list of key concepts for our study. Before your day ends, please review this list and ensure you've covered each item. It's crucial to have a clear grasp of these concepts. Consider explaining them to a teammate to assess your understanding.

- Understand what is a **module** in Motoko, how to import and use them.
- Understand what is the **Base Library** and how to use it.
- Understand how to manipulate control flow operators in Motoko : `if`, `else`, `switch`, `for`, `while` and `switch/case`.
- Understand how the Internet Computer enables new use cases for **DAOs** and how to leverage them.
- Becoming familiar with the Network Nervous System (**NNS**) and how it works.
- Becoming familiar with primitive and non-primitive types in Motoko such as `Nat`, `Int`, `Text`, `Bool`, `Array`, `Buffer`, `Tuples`, `Objects`, `Variants`, `Optionals`, `Generics` and `Shared` types.

## Motoko pill of the day üíä

> On the Motoko programming language's 2nd birthday in 2021, the DFINITY Foundation distributed 10,000 Motoko ghosts designed by Jon Ball of Pokedstudios to the community as NFT collectibles. The collection is still available on [Entrepot](https://opensea.io/collection/motoko-ghosts).
