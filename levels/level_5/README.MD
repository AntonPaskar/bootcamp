# Day 5️⃣

## Introduction

It's Day 5 - Time flies! You should be proud of yourself, as we're nearing the end of the week.

Today, we'll delve into advanced topics, including:

- What is **Internet Identity** and how to use it?
- Accessing to a canister through a browser with HTTP requests.
- Integrating with other blockchains (e.g. Ethereum and Bitcoin).

Mastering those topics will allow you to build more complex and interesting applications on the Internet Computer.
