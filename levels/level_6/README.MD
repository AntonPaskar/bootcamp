# Day 6Ô∏è‚É£

## Introduction

And you've made it. Day 6. Congratulations! <br/>
This is the last day where we will have normal lectures and where we will be coding together. The next two days should be dedicated to your final project.

Today, we'll delve into advanced topics, including:

- Integrating with the Web2 world (eg. by doing HTTP request from a canister).
- Security and best practices when building on the Internet Computer.

## Your tasks ‚úÖ

> This is a checklist of the tasks you need to complete today. You can do more if you want, but this is the minimum required to consider Level 6 as completed.

- Now is the time to start working on [your final project](PROJECT.MD). You should have a clear idea of what you want to build and how you want to build it. If you need help, don't hesitate to reach out to your mentors. You have until Sunday to submit your project.
- You have checked-in with your team and make sure everyone is on track.
